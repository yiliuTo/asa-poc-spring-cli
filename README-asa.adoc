# One-step Deployment ASA Experience with Spring CLI

This poc aims to use a single CLI command `spring asa deploy` to implement one-step deployment in Azure Spring Apps(ASA) for both single module and multiple module maven scenarios.

## Prerequisites
The commands will automatically create apps in ASA and then deploy the local jar to ASA, but it requires that users have already created the below Azure resources:
- Azure subscription
- Azure resource group
- Azure Spring Apps service instance

## How to use

### Single module maven project
There are two solutions, run the command `spring asa deploy` directly in an interactive mode or prepare a manifest.yml then run the command.

#### Run in an interactive mode
1. Step into the root of your project and package it.
2. Run the command `spring asa deploy`.
3. Answer the questions by passing the required information.
4. The deployment will start.

#### Run with manifest file
1. Step into the root of your project and package it.
2. Create a `manifest.yml` file in the root of your project, the format is introduced in the below section.
3. Run the command `spring asa deploy`.
4. The deployment will start.

### Multiple module maven project
For the multiple module maven project, the manifest file is required.

1. Step into the root of your project and package it.
2. Create a `manifest.yml` file in the root of your project, the format is introduced in the below section.
3. Run the command `spring asa deploy`.
4. The deployment will start.

## Features
The supported features of `spring asa deploy` currently contains:

### Deploy directly from the single module maven project
For the case of a single module maven project, `spring asa deploy` can automatically detect the jar file, jdk version and app name from the `pom.xml` file and application.properties / application.yaml file. The information to detect and the sources are:

- app name = ${spring.application.name: artifact-id}
- java version = ${java.version} from pom.xml
- artifact-path = target/${artifact-id}-${version}.${packaging}

Other deployment information will fall back to the default options.

### Deploy the single module maven project with the manifest file

For a single module maven project, users can also choose to override the above values by providing a `manifest.yml` file in the root of the project.

The format and currently supported deployment configuration of the manifest file is as below:
```yaml
  defaults:
    subscription_id: xxx
    resource_group: xxx
    azure_spring_apps_name: xxx

  applications:
  - name: my-app
    memory: 512M  ## optional, the defaut value is 2GB
    instances: 2  ## optional, the defaut value is 1
    path: /path/to/app/bits
    subscription_id: xxx ## optional, will override the above default values, same for the below two
    resource_group: xxx
    azure_spring_apps_name: xxx
```

### Deploy the multiple module maven project with the manifest file
For the multiple module maven project, the manifest file is required, and we don't detect automatically.

The format of the manifest file is the same as above.

### Print application logs after deployment
When the deployment is done, the command will fetch the application log and print it out.

## Known issues

1. When detecting property `spring.application.name` from application configuration for the app name, we only detect the property defined in the default profile configuration, e.g., if users configure in an application-dev.yaml, then it won't take effects for `spring asa deploy`.

2. When choosing to use manifest file for single module deployment, we will not detect the jar file or application name, except for the jdk version. So it's necessary to configure the `applications[x].name` and `application[x].path` properties.

3. Currently, the deployment for multiple modules is executed in a sequential way instead of paralleling.

4. When printing application logs, it's now hard coded that we only print 500 lines and not in a streaming way.
